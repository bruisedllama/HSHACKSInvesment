This app parses the most popular discussions from reddit's financial related subreddits, returns the most common stocks, along with their sentiment rating, then using statistics to determine which stocks are the best to trade, and then implementing our own paper trading system to evaluate the effectiveness of our system. This app uses python to analyze the reddit data and javascript and html to build the site to display all the information. We also used google firebase to store our data so we can analyze trends between days and see which topics are on the rise.
